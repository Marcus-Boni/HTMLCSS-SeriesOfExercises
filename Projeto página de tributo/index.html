                        <h2>1942</h2>
                        <p>Hawking was born on January 8, 1942 and grew up in St. Albans, the eldest of the four
                            brothers.
                            His father was a research biologist, and his mother was a medical research secretary, so it
                            was
                            not surprising that he was interested in science.</p>

                    <div class="time_text">
                        <h2>1965</h2>
                        <p>Stephen studied physics at Oxford and soon after began his doctorate at Cambridge. His life
                            changed when he came across his future wife. Jane was also from St Albans, and was a
                            graduate of modern languages. She can hawking at a New Year's party, before her diagnosis.
                            The couple decided to get married quickly, as they didn't know how long Stephen would have
                            to live.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="time_text">
                        <h2>1970</h2>
                        <p>Working with mathematician Roger Penrose, Hawking realized that black holes were like the Big
                            Bang in reverse — and that meant that the math he used to describe black holes also
                            described the Big Bang. It was a key moment to show that the Big Bang really happened. As
                            his body deteriorated, Hawking's career was taking off.</p>

                    <div class="time_text">
                        <h2>1979</h2>
                        <p>At age 35, Hawking became Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge - a post held by
                            some of Britain's most important physicists, including Newton.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="time_text">
                        <h2>1985</h2>
                        <p>Hawking was admitted to hospital in Geneva with a bout of life-threatening pneumonia. His
                            life hung in the balance. Doctors could only save Stephen by performing an operation that
                            stripped him of his ability to speak. Now, he could only communicate by raising his
                            eyebrows.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="time_text">
                        <h2>1995</h2>
                        <p>After 25 years of marriage and three children, Stephen and Jane Hawking divorced. Stephen
                            married his nurse, Elaine Mason.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="time_text">
                        <h2>2009</h2>
                        <p>AAs required by Cambridge University regulations, Hawking stepped down as a Lucasian
                            professor of mathematics when he turned 67. By this time, he could no longer use his hand to
                            operate the wheelchair, and could only communicate by moving his cheek muscles to control
                            the speech synthesizer.</p>

                        <h2>2018 &#9840</h2>
                        <p>In March 2018 Stephen Hawking died. For fifty-five years, he defied an illness that should
                            have killed him in five. The time passed since his diagnosis wasn't just about survival - he
                            produced all of his work that changed the world.
                            His brilliant theories advanced Einstein's ideas and introduced Hawking into the pantheon of
                            important modern physicists. His surprise book and iconic appearance may have introduced him
                            to the general public, but his insights into gravity, black holes and the Big Bang were his
                            greatest legacy.
